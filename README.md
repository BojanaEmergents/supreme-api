# Supreme API Wrapper
I decided to create a Node.js API for [supremenewyork.com](http://www.supremenewyork.com/), in order to help users keep track of items, that are currently in stock or sold out. This API can be expanded to work with other projects centered around e-commerce, from automatic check out bots, to site monitors. 


## How to install
clone or download and run ```npm install ```

## Features
Requests:
- [ ] All Items
- [ ] Single Item
- [ ] Fetch by Categories
- [ ] Fetch by New
- [x] /random/
- [x] Check if Shop is Open

## Future Improvements
* Watch certain items function
    * watch a category
